conda list snpEff # which will output the location of the directory, which is...
ls /home/ocdm0351/.conda/envs/snpEff
# Next search for the config file
find $CONDA_PREFIX -name "snpEff.config"
/home/ocdm0351/.conda/envs/snpEff/share/snpeff-5.2-1/snpEff.config

# The reason I wanted this is because it has more information about the build of species databases. We search for the species names to see if there's clues:
grep Neurospora_crassa /home/ocdm0351/.conda/envs/snpEff/share/snpeff-5.2-1/snpEff.config

# snpEff uses online data storing services to store the databases. These often lose public accessibility. We therefore might add a manual database approach. 

#1. Add Species Databases to snpEff config file;
